# Research Questions:
* Which countries hosted the olymics the most? and how many countries that had never hosted the event?
* Which countries participate the most in the olympics?
* Does having the most medals means being good at many games?
* Do some countries achieve most of their medals in certain sports only? 
* Is there a boom in female participation a certain year? do all countries   have similar history?
* Do countries with more female participation achieve more medals
* Does Male Athletes of Egypt bring more medals in the olympics than their female counterpart? What about other countries?
